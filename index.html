<h1>Dick Balaska's POV-Ray</h1>
<p>This clone of POV-Ray contains two branches:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>network</b> - This branch contains povrayws, a version of POV-Ray that replaces the front end with websockets. 
This program is then slaved to my IDE <a href="http://www.buckosoft.com/qtpov/">qtpov</a>. Tested on Linux and Windows.</li>
<li><b>qmake</b> - This branch replaces the automake build process with qmake.  
Also it integrates the qtpov IDE for one big happy binary.  Currently tested only on Linux.</li>
</ul>
